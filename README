iPXE
===
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/csc/ipxe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/csc/ipxe)

iPXE is the leading open source network boot firmware. It provides a full PXE implementation enhanced with additional features such as:

* boot from a web server via HTTP
* boot from an iSCSI SAN
* boot from a Fibre Channel SAN via FCoE
* boot from an AoE SAN
* boot from a wireless network
* boot from a wide-area network
* boot from an Infiniband network
* control the boot process with a []script](http://ipxe.org/scripting)

You can use iPXE to [replace the existing PXE ROM on your network card](http://ipxe.org/howto/romburning), or you can [chainload into iPXE](http://ipxe.org/howto/chainloading) to obtain the features of iPXE without the hassle of reflashing.

iPXE is free, open-source software [licensed](http://ipxe.org/licensing) under the GNU GPL (with some portions under GPL-compatible licences), and is included in products from several network card manufacturers and OEMs.

Changes to the original iPXE
===
This fork of the original [iPXE](https://github.com/ipxe/ipxe) is a 99.99% genuine copy but we have turned ```IMAGE_COMBOOT``` flag on to enable SYSLINUX COMBOOT image support (we also added .travis.yml to enable builds via [travis-CI.org](https://travis-ci.org/csc/ipxe)).  

This change allows booting of [ESXi 5.x VMs](https://github.com/csc/Hanlon/issues/46)
