%description
iPXE is the leading open source network boot firmware. It provides a full PXE
implementation enhanced with additional features such as:

* boot from a web server via HTTP
* boot from an iSCSI SAN
* boot from a Fibre Channel SAN via FCoE
* boot from an AoE SAN
* boot from a wireless network
* boot from a wide-area network
* boot from an Infiniband network
* control the boot process with a script

You can use iPXE to replace the existing PXE ROM on your network card, or you
can chainload into iPXE to obtain the features of iPXE without the hassle of
reflashing.

iPXE is free, open-source software licensed under the GNU GPL (with some
portions under GPL-compatible licences), and is included in products from
several network card manufacturers and OEMs.
